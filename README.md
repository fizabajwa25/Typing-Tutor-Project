# Typing Tutor

## Project Overview
Typing Tutor is a C++ command-line application developed as part of CS 141 (Spring 2023). It simulates a typing assistant that helps users practice spelling and improve their typing speed. The program includes a menu system for practicing commonly misspelled words, random dictionary words, searching for specific words, and displaying indexed word ranges.

## Objectives and Goals
- Practice modular programming and algorithm design using C++.
- Develop a text-based menu system for user interaction.
- Work with file input/output and dynamic word datasets.
- Implement features like binary search, input validation, and scoring mechanisms.

## Features
- Practice typing from a curated list of commonly misspelled words.
- Practice typing random words from a full dictionary.
- View subsets of word lists by providing index ranges.
- Search for a specific word using binary search.
- Score tracking with correct answers and penalties for misspelled words.
- Detailed feedback after each typing session.

## Tech Stack
- Language: C++
- Build Tools: G++, GNU Make
- Configuration: Replit Nix (with `clang_12`, `ccls`, `gdb`)

## File Structure

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `program3.cc` | Main C++ source code file |
| `dictionary.txt` | Word list used for full dictionary typing |
| `misspelled.txt` | Word pairs (misspelled â†’ correct) |
| `Makefile` | Compilation script (`make` to build) |
| `replit.nix` | Dependency file for Replit (optional use) |
| `main`, `main-debug`, `main.o` | Compiled binaries (should be excluded via `.gitignore`) |
